# Vilay Demo App

## Trying the demo app

1. Create a new [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo).
2. Create `.env.local` file containing the token you just created. See `.env.example` for an example.
3. Run `npm run dev` and `npm run relay -w` in two separate terminals.
4. Open the URL logged in the first terminal and the app appears.
